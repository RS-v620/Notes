#axiom
Given a set of events $S$, an #event $E$  from this Sample space, three axioms are proposed.
**AXIOM 1 :** $$0 \leq P(E) \leq 1 $$
**AXIOM : 2** $$P(S) = 1$$
**AXIOM 3:** For any sequence of <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">mutually exclusive</mark> events $E_1$ , $E_2$, $...$  , i.e. events for which $E_i\cdot E_j = \emptyset$ when $i\neq j$
$$P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}E_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}P(E_i),\;\;n=1,2,...,\infty$$
We call $P(E)$ the probability of event $E$.
 
It should be noted that if we interpret P(E ) as the relative frequency of the event E when a large number of repetitions of the experiment are performed, then P(E ) would indeed satisfy the above axioms.

### Proposition 3.4.1
$$P(E^c)=1- P ( E )$$
### Proposition 3.4.2 
$$P(E\cup F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E\cap )$$
