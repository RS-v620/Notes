# Introduction
Probability has two foregoing interpretations which are:
- subjective : personal interpretation of probability ( There is a $50$% chance that this one coin flip will land with heads up )
- frequential :  referring to the chance of occurrence in large number of tests (If One performs 100 flips of this coin, 50 of them will come with head up.)

The frequential interpretation is the most prevalent among scientists. 

In the subjective interpretation, the probability of an outcome is not thought of as being a property of the outcome but rather is considered a statement about the beliefs of the person stating the probability, concerning the change that the event will occur. This interpretation is favored by philosopher and economic decision makers.

There is a general consensus that the mathematics of probability remains the same in either interpretation

# Sample Space and Events
#sampleSpace #event
In an experiment where all possible outcomes are known in advance, this set of of all possible outcomes is known as the **sample space** of the experiment and is denoted by $S$.
Any subset $E$ of $S$ is known as an **event**. That is an event is consisting of possible outcomes of the experiment. If the outcome of the experiment is contained in $E$, then we say that *event* $E$ has occurred.


### Common notations and associations :
#union #intersection 
Let there be two event $E$ and $F$  in sample space $S$.
We define $$E \;\bigcup \;F$$ as the event  consisting of all outcomes that are either in $E$ or in $F$. This is called the **union** of the events. That is $E\;\bigcup\;F$ will occur if *either* $E$ or $F$ occurs.

Similarly, $$EF$$ is defined as the *intersection* of $E$ and $F$, consisting of all outcomes common in $E$ and $F$.
If $EF = \emptyset$ 

# Types of Events
#### Elementary Event
#simpleEvent #elementaryEvent
An event having only a single sample point is called an **elementary** or **simple** event.

#### Equally Likely Event
#equallyLikelyEvent
For a group of events, they are said to be equally likely if their occurrence has no preference.

#### Independent Event
#independentEvents 
If occurrence of one event doesn't effect, or cause the occurrence of another event, they are said to be independent events.

#### Mutually Exclusive Events
#mutuallyExclusiveEvents
A set of events is called mutually exclusive if occurrence of one of the events precludes(make impossible) the occurrence of any other events in the set. Suppose $E_1, E_2, ... , E_n$ are mutually-exclusive events, then : $$ E_1 \cap E_2 \cap \; ... \; \cap E_n = \emptyset $$
#### Exhaustive Events
#exhaustiveEvents
If a set of events $E_1, E_2, ..., E_n$ completely cover up the entire [[Elements of Probability#Sample Space and Events | sample space]] , i.e. $$E_1 \cup E_2 \cup ... \cup E_n = S$$
#### Mutually Exclusive and Exhaustive Events
A set of event is said to be mutually exclusive if they are both exclusive and exhaustive at the same time
