A *set* that supports addition, search and deletion is called a #dictionary. A set holds immutable definition in mathematics, but in programming, it refers to a *dynamic* arrays.

## Elementary Data Structures
Stacks and queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed form the set by the DELETE operation is prespecified. In a #stack , the deletion follows *last-in first-out* principle, whereas in a queue, the *first-in first-out* principle is followed.
