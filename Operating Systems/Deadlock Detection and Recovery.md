1. The system does not do anything except monitor the requests and releases of resources. Every time a resource is requested or released, the resource graph is updated, and a check is made to see if any cycles exist. If a cycle exists, one of the processes in the cycle is killed. If this does not break the deadlock, another process is killed, and so on until the cycle is broken.

2. A somewhat cruder method is not even to maintain the resource graph but instead periodically check to see if there are any processes that have been continuously blocked for more than say, 1 hour. Such processes are then killed.
