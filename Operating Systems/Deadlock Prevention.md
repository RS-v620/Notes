The strategy is to impose suitable restrictions on processes so
that deadlocks are structurally impossible. The four conditions provide a clue to some possible solutions.

1. **Mutual Exclusion Condition** : This problem can be solved by #Spooling , ie using a dedicated storage whose entire job to transfer data between the processes and I/O devices. Unfortunately not all devices can be spooled. Furthermore, the competition for disk space for spooling can lead to deadlock.
2. **Processes can request more resources** : We can remove deadlocks if we can prevent processes that already are in possession of a resource to demand more resources. One way to do this is to require all processors to request all their resources at once before starting execution. But this approach only works for statically typed programs. Another issue is that the resources will not be used optimally, as long programs will lock up resources.
3. **Hold and Wait condition** : A slightly different way to break the hold-and-wait condition is to require a process requesting a resource to first temporarily release all the resources it currently holds. Then it tries to get everything it needs all at once.
4. Another **way to avoid the circular wait** is to provide a global numbering of all the resources. Now the rule is this: processes can request resources whenever they want to, but all requests must be made in numerical order. A process may request first a scanner and then a tape drive, but it may  not request first a plotter and then a scanner. Although numerically ordering the resources eliminates the problem of deadlocks, it may be impossible to find an ordering that satisfies everyone.
