The OS provides an environment for the execution of programs. The OS provides certain services to programs and to the users of those programs.
These are : 
1. Program Execution :
	The system is capable of loading programs into the memory and executing them, and then ending its execution.
2. I/O Operation : 
	OS provides easy interface with the I/O devices, using drivers, and driver-system interface.
3. File System Manipulation :
>[!info] 
>OS provides facilities to read, write and backup files, in internal as well as external memory
4. Communications : Processes often need to transfer information with each other, either on the same computer or on different computers. The OS enables this communication in two ways, either by assigning *shared memory* with the processes, or by *message passing* via computer networks.
5. Error Detection : OS handles errors generated both due to system failure or due to error-tied interrupts where error is not in the machine but external.
These OS function are dedicated to provide ease to the user. There is another set of OS operations that help in efficient operation of hardware. 

1. Resource Allocation : OS handles access of resources to processes. OS therefore has CPU-Scheduling routines to provide optimum CPU usage, main memory allocation routines, I/O request handlers.
2. Accounting : OS often maintains a record of the total resources allocated to a user, used by cloud providers for charging users money.
3. Protection : No inter-user interference, no inter-process interference, controlled access to system resources, user authentication, I/O device authentication, connection records.
