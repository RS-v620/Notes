## Circuit Switching
If two processes want to communicate, a permanent physical link is established between them. This link is allocated for the duration of the communication, and no other process can use that link during this period (even if the two processes are not actively communicating for a while).

## Packet Switching
One logical message may have to be divided into a number of packets. Each packet is sent to its destination separately, and therefore must include a source and destination address with its data. Each packet may take a different path through the network. The packets must be reassembled into messages as they arrive.
