#OperatingSystems 
**Operating System** : It is a program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware. It has two goals:
1. Primary goal is to make the computer system convenient to use
2. Secondary goal is to use the hardware in an efficient manner


There are some allegories that can be used to define the OS, like a *government* i.e. it simply provides an environment within which other programs can function well. A *resource allocator* that acts as a manager. And finally a *Control Program* that controls the operation and control of I/O devices.

The most common definition is that an OS is a program that is running at all times on the computer(called a *kernel*), with everything else being application programs.

A computer can be divided into 4 components, *hardware,  operating system, users* and the *application programs*. 

The operating system acts as the manager to allocate :
1. CPU Time
2. Memory Space
3. File Storage Space
4. I/O Devices
The OS is a *control program*. 

So in general the purpose of an operating system is to provide convenience the user, use hardware efficiently, and provide routines to execute commonplace regular tasks without requiring the user to run its own application program.
