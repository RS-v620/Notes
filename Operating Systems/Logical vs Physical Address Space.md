An address generated by the CPU is commonly referred to as a #logicalAddress aka #virtualAddress, whereas an address seen by the memory unit (that is, the one loaded into the memory address register of the memory) is commonly referred to as a #physicalAddress.
The compile-time and load-time address-binding schemes result in an environment where the logical and physical addresses are the same. However, the execution-time address-binding scheme results in an environment where the logical and physical addresses differ. The set of all logical addresses generated by the program is called #logicalAddressSpace, and the set of all physical addresses corresponding to them is called #physcialAddressSpace. in execution-time binding, the logical and physical address spaces differ.

The run-time mapping from virtual to physical addresses is done by the #memoryManagementUnit (MMU), which is a hardware device.

The following example shows the simplest scheme: 
The base register is renamed as #relocationRegister. Its value is **added** to all the addresses generated by the user process, acting as offset.

The user program never sees the physical address.The final location of a referenced memory address is not determined until the reference is made, hence the execution time binding.
