The central nervous system for distress signals. It integrates multiple trigger inputs:

- **Manual Triggers:** SOS button, physical hardware.
    
- **Software Triggers:** Voice activation, failed "responsive feedback" checks in high-risk zones.
    
- **Automatic Triggers:** When environmental cues (e.g., sudden prolonged stop in a red zone) cross a high-risk threshold.
