The three state is a digital circuit that exhibits three exhibits.
The states are : 
1. **Digital 1** : This is represented by the flow of current out of a buffer. 
2. **Digital 0** : This is represented by the flow of current into a buffer.
3. **High Impedance State** : This is when the circuit behave as an Open Circuit and no exchange of current can take place, hence making it effectively a third state.

These are most commonly used to design Bus system.
