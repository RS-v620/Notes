1. **Concurrency model**
	- [x] What is concurrency
    - [x]  sync vs async
    - [x]  threads vs processes 
    - [x] where the GIL bites you
    - [x] Issues with Concurrency
        
2. **Async I/O**
    - [x] `asyncio` event loop
    - [ ]  `await` costs
    - [ ]  blocking calls inside async (the silent killer)
        
3. **Profiling**
    - [ ]  `cProfile`
    - [ ]  identify CPU-bound vs I/O-bound code

### BUILD 

A **tiny benchmark repo**
- [ ]  One sync endpoint
- [ ] One async endpoint
- [ ]  Same logic
- [ ]  Measure:
    - latency
    - throughput
    - CPU usage

You must be able to answer:
> “Why is async faster _here_ and useless _there_?”

If you can’t explain that, interviews will destroy you.

### Deliverable by end of Week 1
You should have:
- a small repo
- numbers (before/after)
- a **written explanation** (even rough)
Not blog-worthy. Interview-worthy.

---
### Time expectation
- ~1.5–2 hrs/day
- If you skip days, the plan collapses
